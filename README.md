# Low Code Data Analysis in MATLAB&reg;
Data analysis is an integral part of many engineering and scientific workflows. However, applying the right data analysis techniques typically takes lots of manual coding before getting useful results. It can be particularly challenging when the familiarity with the data is low. MATLABâ€™s apps and Live Editor Tasks make it easy to explore, clean, prepare and complete these data analysis tasks with little to no coding. The tools can also automatically generate code for review and reuse. This demo will use a real-world time series data and walk through different low code capabilities in MATLAB that can help you get started and develop your data analysis code faster.


## Setup
Open and run LowCodeWorkflowTemplate_Complete.mlx

### MathWorks&reg; Products (https://www.mathworks.com)
The Import Live Task used in the demo requires MATLAB release R2023a or newer. Other low code tools showed in the demo require MATLAB release R2022a or newer.
